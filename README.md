Budget Wise: Wisely manage your budget

Budget WIse is a web app that will help you keep track of your spending, and calculate your budget. Budget Wise will allow you to log your expenses based on two categories: one is the spending category, and the other is based on need, want, or save. Budget Wise will generate two analytic graphs based on those two categories. Additionally, Budget Wise also allows you to calculate how much your monthly income should go towards saving, want, or need.
